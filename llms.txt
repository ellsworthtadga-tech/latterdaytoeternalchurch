# Latter-Day to Eternal Church
# https://latterdaytoeternalchurch.church
# A Catholic apologetics ministry examining Latter-day Saint doctrine
# through Scripture, the Church Fathers, and 2,000 years of Christian tradition.

## Purpose
This site exists to help seekers — particularly those from a Latter-day Saint
background — examine the historical and doctrinal claims of both Catholicism and
Mormonism with intellectual rigor and charity. All arguments are grounded in
primary sources: Scripture, patristic texts, conciliar documents, the Catechism
of the Catholic Church, and the LDS Church's own Gospel Topics essays.

## Audience
- Latter-day Saints curious about or investigating Catholicism
- Catholics seeking to understand LDS doctrine and how to engage it
- Protestant Christians comparing Catholic and LDS truth claims
- General seekers interested in early Church history and Christian origins

## Key Topics Covered
- The Holy Eucharist and Real Presence (John 6, Church Fathers, Catholic doctrine)
- Apostolic Succession and ecclesial authority (Ignatius, Irenaeus, Matthew 16:18)
- The Nature of God and the Trinity vs. LDS eternal progression and polytheism
- Salvation, grace, and LDS exaltation theology (D&C 132, King Follett Discourse)
- Scripture, canon formation, and Sola Scriptura
- LDS historical truth claims (Joseph Smith polygamy, First Vision accounts, Book of Mormon archaeology)
- The Great Apostasy claim and Catholic continuity
- Covenant theology and progressive revelation vs. LDS primordial dispensationalism

## Methodology
Arguments are tested across three criteria:
1. Biblical exegesis — reading Scripture in its literary, historical, and canonical context
2. Historical continuity — the witness of the Church Fathers and two millennia of tradition
3. Internal coherence — testing doctrines on their own terms for logical consistency

## Perspective
This site argues from a Roman Catholic perspective and affirms the teachings of
the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Critiques of LDS doctrine are offered
charitably and draw from LDS primary sources wherever possible, including the
LDS Church's own Gospel Topics essays.
